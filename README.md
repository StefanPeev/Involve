# Involve
Font family Involve is based on the project [Evolventa](https://github.com/evolventa/evolventa). Evolventa is a Cyrillic extension of the open-source URW Gothic L font family. Evolventa is copyrighted (c) 2016 by Alex I. Kuznetsov and it is published under two open source licenses: GPLv2 and LPPL.
  
Involve extendes the multilanguage coverage of Evolventa and changes the geometry of some glyphs. It includes also new styles (Medium, SemiBold) as well as a variable font format. The project Involve is maintained by Stefan Peev on GitHub. Involve is published under SIL Open Font license v.1.1.
